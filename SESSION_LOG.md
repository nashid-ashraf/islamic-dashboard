# Islamic Dashboard — Session Log

**Date:** 2026-04-15
**Session:** Initial setup — research, requirements, architecture, Phase 1+2 implementation

---

## What was accomplished

### Research & Planning
- Analyzed all existing files: HTML prototype, Perplexity research doc, architecture diagrams
- Asked user 4 scoping questions (tech stack, MVP features, storage, extras)
- Wrote `REQUIREMENTS.md` — 50+ functional requirements across 4 modules
- Deployed 3 parallel agents for Web, Android, iOS deployment assessments
- Created `ASSESSMENT_WEB.md`, `ASSESSMENT_ANDROID.md`, `ASSESSMENT_IOS.md`
- Wrote comprehensive `README.md` consolidating all research

### User Decisions
- **Tech Stack:** React Native (Expo) + Vite React web — monorepo with npm workspaces
- **MVP Scope:** ALL four features (Enhanced Quran, Smart Prayer Times, Custom Reminders, Offline/PWA)
- **Storage:** Local now, cloud later (StorageService interface pre-architected)
- **Extras:** None for v1 (Qibla, Dhikr, Hadith deferred to v2)

### Phase 1: Monorepo Scaffolding (COMPLETE)
- Root `package.json` with npm workspaces
- `tsconfig.base.json` with strict TS, path aliases
- `packages/shared/` — `@islamic-dashboard/shared` library
- `packages/web/` — Vite + React with lazy routes, dark theme CSS, PWA manifest
- `packages/mobile/` — Expo Router with tab navigation, dark theme, notification/location plugins

### Phase 2: Shared Business Logic (COMPLETE)
- **Models:** `prayer.ts`, `quran.ts`, `reminder.ts` — all TypeScript interfaces
- **API Clients:** `aladhan.ts` (prayer by city/coords), `alquran.ts` (surah + translation, surah list)
- **Storage:** `StorageService` interface + `LocalStorageAdapter` (web implementation)
- **Hooks:** `usePrayerTimes`, `useQuran`, `useBookmarks`, `useReminders`, `useReadingPosition`
- **Utils:** `dateHelpers.ts` (prayer time parsing, countdown), `theme.ts` (shared design tokens)

### Verification
- Shared package: typechecks clean
- Web package: typechecks clean, Vite builds to 55 KB gzipped
- All pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/nashid-ashraf/islamic-dashboard

---

## What's next — Phase 3: Web App

Wire the shared hooks into real web UI components:

1. **Dashboard page** — Prayer times card (using `usePrayerTimes`), continue-reading card (using `useReadingPosition`), upcoming reminders summary
2. **Quran Reader page** — Full reader with surah dropdown, 10-ayah scrollable display, load-more, IntersectionObserver auto-save, bookmark system
3. **Reminders page** — Create/edit/delete form, reminder list with complete toggle, sorted by due time
4. **Service Worker** — Workbox caching (cache-first for Quran, stale-while-revalidate for Aladhan)
5. **Geolocation service** — `navigator.geolocation` wrapper for auto-detecting prayer location
6. **Notification service** — Web Notification API for prayer time and reminder alerts

### Phase 4: Mobile App (after Phase 3)
Port web UI to React Native components using same shared hooks.

### Phase 5: CI/CD
GitHub Actions for web (Cloudflare Pages) and mobile (EAS Build).

## Key files to know
```
packages/shared/src/index.ts          — Barrel export (all shared modules)
packages/shared/src/api/aladhan.ts    — Prayer times API client
packages/shared/src/api/alquran.ts    — Quran API client
packages/shared/src/hooks/            — All 5 React hooks
packages/shared/src/storage/types.ts  — StorageService interface
packages/web/src/App.tsx              — Web app shell (lazy routes)
packages/web/src/pages/               — Dashboard, QuranReader, Reminders (placeholder)
packages/mobile/app/                  — Expo Router screens (placeholder)
```

## React version note
Using React 18.3 across the monorepo (React Native 0.76 requires React 18, not 19). Will upgrade when Expo moves to RN 0.77+.

---

## Session 2 — Phase 3 wiring (2026-04-17)

Wired the shared hooks into real web UI:
- `Dashboard.tsx` — prayer-times card, continue-reading card, upcoming-reminders card
- `QuranReader.tsx` — surah dropdown, 10-ayah progressive display, IntersectionObserver auto-save, bookmark toggles, `?surah=&ayah=` deep-link resume
- `Reminders.tsx` — create/edit/delete form, `ReminderRow` with complete toggle, sorted sections
- Web services: `services/storage.ts` (LocalStorageAdapter singleton), `services/geolocation.ts`, `services/notifications.ts` (setTimeout + Notification API, keyed by `prayer:*` / `reminder:*`)
- Vite PWA: `vite-plugin-pwa` with `autoUpdate`, CacheFirst for alquran.cloud, StaleWhileRevalidate for aladhan.com
- Typecheck + `vite build` both clean; main bundle ≈58 KB gzipped

Committed as `78c9d6a` — "Wire web UI to shared hooks (Phase 3)".

---

## Session 3 — Phase 3 polish (2026-04-18)

Two streams of work driven by `@javascript-typescript:javascript-pro` (HTML/a11y assessment) and `@comprehensive-review:architect-review` (architecture audit).

### Accessibility pass
- Semantic landmarks: `<section aria-labelledby>` for cards, `<article>` for ayahs, `aria-label="Primary"` on `<nav>`, skip-link to `<main id="main">`
- `lang="ar" dir="rtl"` on Arabic ayah text; `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative star glyphs
- `role="alert"` / `role="status" aria-live="polite"` on error and loading messages
- Per-route `document.title`, `<meta description>` in `index.html`
- CSS: `.skip-link` that appears on focus only

### Architectural refactor (resolves ship-blockers from the review)
- **Hexagonal ports** — new `packages/shared/src/ports/` with `StorageService`, `GeolocationProvider`, `NotificationScheduler`. `LocalStorageAdapter` moved out of shared into `packages/web/src/services/`. Shared no longer imports any browser globals.
- **API caching + timeouts** — new `packages/shared/src/api/httpClient.ts` with AbortController-based timeout + in-memory TTL cache + composed signals. AlAdhan client now uses `/timings/{DD-MM-YYYY}` so URLs are stable for 24h (was `/timings/{unix_ts}` which defeated HTTP caching). TTLs: AlAdhan 6h, AlQuran 24h.
- **Notification re-hydration** — new `NotificationOrchestrator` component at App root subscribes to `usePrayerTimes` + `useReminders` and re-schedules on every boot (web timers are in-memory and lost on reload). Previously lived in `Dashboard.tsx`, so reminders silently never fired when the user landed on `/reminders` or `/quran` first. The web scheduler also exposes an `onPermissionChange` signal so the Dashboard "Enable" button propagates to the orchestrator.
- Web services refactored into classes implementing their ports: `WebNotificationScheduler`, `WebGeolocationProvider`.

### README diagrams
Replaced dark-on-dark PNG diagrams with inline Mermaid — renders theme-aware on GitHub and is editable alongside the code.

### Verification
`npm run typecheck` (shared + web) and `vite build` both pass. Bundle ≈58 KB gzipped. **Not click-tested** — NotificationOrchestrator needs a manual reload-test once a browser is available.

### Still open (architect review nice-to-haves)
- `ServicesContext` to avoid threading singletons into each page
- Root `ErrorBoundary`
- Delete legacy `islamic_dashboard.html` prototype at repo root

---

## Session 4 — Vitest suite + CI (2026-04-20)

Closed two of the top nice-to-haves from Session 3.

- Vitest + jsdom + `@testing-library/react` wired into `packages/shared` (`vitest.config.ts`, setup adds `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` matchers).
- In-memory `StorageService` test double at `packages/shared/src/test/mockStorage.ts` — exposes `.state` so assertions read persisted values directly without spies.
- 30 tests across `httpClient`, `dateHelpers`, `useBookmarks`, `useReadingPosition`, `useReminders`. `useQuran` + `usePrayerTimes` deferred until they get touched (need fetch mocking).
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Node 20, typecheck + test + `build:web` on every push/PR to `main`.

Committed as `6cd1aca` — "Add Vitest test suite and GitHub Actions CI".

---

## Session 5 — Requirements expansion + Reminder model v1 refactor (2026-04-21)

Expanded scope significantly, then landed the architectural refactor that unblocks the new scope.

### Requirements capture (REQUIREMENTS.md)
- **§5A** — 18 handwritten items from a user photo captured as FR-EX1–FR-EX18 (salah pie chart, post-salah tasbih, Duha, post-Maghrib sunnah, Friday Kahf, Mulk/Sajdah before sleep, ayah/hadith of the day, adhkar routines, weekly sunnah).
- **§5A.5b + §5A.6** — reclassification: FR-EX3/4/6/7/8 (Duha, post-Maghrib, Kahf, Mulk, Sajdah) are **pre-seeded default reminders**, not net-new features. Table showing 12 of 18 items reduce to "sticky reminders" once the Reminder model supports `weekdays`, `category`, `actionLink`, `builtIn`, `completions[]`, `prayerAnchor?`.
- **§5B** — three new directives from `raw-updated-reqs.md`:
  - FR-EX19: opt-in full-Quran offline cache (~7 MB).
  - FR-EX20–22: weekly reminder recap with % completion + per-day breakdown.
  - FR-EX23–25: Hisnul Muslim adhkar corpus imported in-app (reversal of the earlier deep-link-out plan).
- **§5C** — 8-point architectural implications list, validated by the `backend-api-security:backend-architect` agent.

### Reminder model v1 refactor
- Replaced flat shape (`complete: boolean`, `repeat: 'none'|'daily'|'weekly'`, flat `dueTime`) with a discriminated `ReminderSchedule` union: `none / once / daily / weekly / prayerAnchor`. Added `completions[]`, `builtIn`, `enabled`, `action` (`quran` / `adhkar`), `category`, `version: 1`.
- `migrateReminders(raw)` migrates any mix of v0 / v1 / malformed records; `LocalStorageAdapter.getReminders` writes back once so v0 disappears from disk after first load.
- New pure helper `resolveNextFireAt(reminder, now)` in `packages/shared/src/utils/reminderSchedule.ts` — handles daily roll-to-tomorrow, weekly roll-to-next-weekday, completion-aware skipping, returns `null` for `prayerAnchor` (orchestrator materializes those).
- `useReminders.toggleComplete(id)` now appends/removes today's completion rather than flipping a boolean. `deleteReminder` soft-disables built-ins (`enabled: false`) instead of hard-deleting.
- NotificationOrchestrator switched from raw `r.dueTime` to `resolveNextFireAt`.
- Test coverage: +13 model tests, +15 schedule-util tests, +2 hook tests (v0 migration on load, soft-delete invariant). 61/61 passing.
- **Gotcha documented in project memory:** `vi.useFakeTimers()` is incompatible with `@testing-library/react`'s `waitFor` (polls via setTimeout). Hook tests use real time and derive "today" via `localDateKey()`.

Committed as `daa71cb` — "Refactor Reminder model to support built-in catalog and completion history".

---

## Session 6 — Quran offline corpus scaffold (2026-04-22)

Landed the Phase 3.4 / FR-EX19 foundation as a new hexagonal port + web adapter. Fully independent of the Reminder refactor.

### Edition set
After API discovery: `ar-uthmani`, `en-sahih`, `en-khattab`, `bn-muhiuddin`. Mustafa Khattab's Clear Quran isn't on quran.com's public v4 API — pivoted to the **fawazahmed0/quran-api CDN** (JSDelivr-hosted static JSON) as a second upstream. IndoPak is rendered via a font swap on the Uthmani text, not a separately-cached edition.

### Files added
- `packages/shared/src/models/editions.ts` — edition registry with per-edition upstream routing.
- `packages/shared/src/ports/quranCorpus.ts` — `QuranOfflineCorpus` port contract.
- `packages/shared/src/api/quranCdn.ts` — fawazahmed0 CDN client.
- `packages/shared/src/test/mockQuranCorpus.ts` — in-memory test double matching `mockStorage`'s `.state` pattern.
- `packages/shared/src/ports/quranCorpus.test.ts` — 5 contract tests (null-when-empty, progress monotonicity, resumability, abort, invalidate).
- `packages/shared/src/hooks/useQuran.test.tsx` — 4 tests for the cache-first branch (network fallback, full cache hit, cache miss, half-cached pair).
- `packages/web/src/services/quranCorpus.ts` — `IndexedDbQuranCorpus` adapter via `idb-keyval`, singleton export.
- `packages/web/src/components/QuranCorpusConsent.tsx` — consent banner with progress bar, "Not now" / "Don't ask again", and silent ITP re-hydrate.
- `packages/web/public/fonts/README.md` — IndoPak font asset guidance (SIL OFL options documented; license decision pending).

### Files modified
- `packages/shared/src/models/quran.ts` — added `EditionAyah` + `EditionSurah` types.
- `packages/shared/src/api/alquran.ts` — added `fetchEditionSurah(slug, n, signal)` for per-edition fetches.
- `packages/shared/src/hooks/useQuran.ts` — accepts an options object (`{ corpus, arabicEdition, translationEdition }`); cache-first path merges two cached editions into the flat `Ayah` shape.
- `packages/web/src/pages/QuranReader.tsx` — passes the corpus, renders the consent banner, adds a Uthmani ↔ IndoPak script selector that flips `data-quran-script` on `<html>`.
- `packages/web/src/styles/global.css` — `--quran-arabic-font` CSS variable with Uthmani/IndoPak font stacks, swapped via `html[data-quran-script]`.
- `packages/web/package.json` — adds `idb-keyval@^6.2.1`.

### Storage design
IndexedDB store `islamic-dashboard-quran/corpus`. Keys: `quran:surah:{edition}:{n}` for records, `quran:manifest` for the `CorpusManifest`. Hydration batches 4 surahs in parallel, persists the manifest after each batch — a mid-download close preserves progress (resumable without re-fetching).

### Verification
`npm run -w packages/shared test` → 70/70 passing (+9 new: 5 corpus, 4 useQuran). `npm run -w packages/web typecheck` + `build` both clean. QuranReader chunk grew 7.49 KB → 16.05 KB (gz 2.87 → 5.81 KB); total precache 205 KB.

### Not done in this pass
- IndoPak font binary — CSS variable toggle works but falls through to system fonts until a font file is shipped. `public/fonts/README.md` documents the licensing decision (Scheherazade New OFL recommended).
- Mobile adapter (`expo-file-system`) — deferred to Phase 4.
- Pre-seeded reminder catalog — the Reminder model supports `builtIn: true` but no seed data ships yet.

### Still open (next-up candidates)
- Click-test the browser flow: fresh consent → download → offline navigation → ITP eviction simulation.
- Seed `packages/shared/data/builtInReminders.ts` for FR-EX3/4/6/7/8.
- Prayer-anchored orchestration in `NotificationOrchestrator` (today, `resolveNextFireAt` returns null for `prayerAnchor` by design).
- Weekly recap aggregator (FR-EX20–22) — projection over `completions[]`.

## Session 7 — Adhkar content scaffold (2026-04-22)

Landed the Phase 3.5 / FR-EX23–25 foundation. Adhkar content now has a home in the monorepo and an end-to-end reader UI on web, without bundling any licensed editorial content.

### Design choice driving the whole scaffold
The Darussalam editions of Hisn al-Muslim (Arabic + English + Bengali translations) are not redistributable. Most "open" online datasets contain laundered Darussalam text. Rather than audit every candidate, the scaffold ships only duas whose Arabic text is **the Quran itself** — universally public domain — and represents them by `quranRef` pointers that resolve against the already-cached `QuranOfflineCorpus`. No translation, transliteration, or hadith-Arabic text is bundled. The reader UI degrades gracefully when the corpus isn't hydrated: it renders a "open in Quran reader →" link instead of broken empty text.

Hadith-derived duas (most of morning/evening, all of waking-up) are left as explicit gaps with a curation note, and `LICENSES.md` documents the approved upstream sources (sunnah.com CC-BY and Seen-Arabic MIT for morning+evening).

### Files added
- `packages/shared/src/models/adhkar.ts` — `Dua`, `AdhkarRoutine`, `QuranRef`, `LanguageCode` types. The `AdhkarRoutineId` string union moved here (was previously in `reminder.ts`; renamed from `AdhkarRoutine` to free that name for the structured type).
- `packages/shared/src/data/adhkar/{morning,evening,sleep,waking}.json` — four routine seeds. Morning/evening hold the three Quls (Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq, An-Nas) per Abu Dawud 5082. Sleep holds Ayat al-Kursi, last two of Al-Baqarah, and the three Quls per Bukhari 5008/5010/5017. Waking is empty pending curation.
- `packages/shared/src/data/adhkar/LICENSES.md` — provenance rules, forbidden sources (Darussalam/Mohiuddin Khan/Abu Bakr Zakaria), approved upstream sources (sunnah.com CC-BY, Seen-Arabic MIT, fitrahive MIT), per-entry curation checklist.
- `packages/shared/src/data/adhkar/index.ts` — typed barrel: `ADHKAR_ROUTINES: Record<AdhkarRoutineId, AdhkarRoutine>` plus `ADHKAR_ROUTINE_IDS`. Out-of-scope routines (`friday-post-asr`, `post-salah`) ship as empty stubs with curation notes so `AdhkarRoutineId` stays exhaustive at the type level.
- `packages/shared/src/hooks/useAdhkarRoutine.ts` — hook that loads a routine synchronously and, when a `QuranOfflineCorpus` is supplied, asynchronously resolves each `quranRef` against the corpus. Returns `resolvedDuas: ResolvedDua[]` where `resolvedArabicAyahs` is either inline Arabic, corpus-resolved ayahs, or `null`.
- `packages/shared/src/hooks/useAdhkarRoutine.test.tsx` — 4 tests: no-corpus fallback, full corpus resolution (Ayat al-Kursi + Baqarah 285-286), missing-surah returns null, out-of-scope routines expose empty arrays.
- `packages/web/src/pages/AdhkarRoutine.tsx` — `/adhkar/:routine` page. Tab navigation between the four routines, curation-note surface when a routine is partial/empty, per-dua cards with repetition counter (`0/3`, `0/33`, etc.). Arabic renders from `resolvedArabicAyahs`, falls back to a Quran-reader deep-link when the corpus is empty.

### Files modified
- `packages/shared/src/models/reminder.ts` — `AdhkarRoutine` string union renamed to `AdhkarRoutineId`; `ReminderAction.kind === 'adhkar'` still references it.
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts` — barrel exports for the new model, hook, and `ADHKAR_ROUTINES` registry.
- `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` — include pattern expanded to `src/**/*.json` so the four JSON files actually compile into the shared project.
- `packages/web/src/App.tsx` — lazy route `/adhkar/:routine` + an "Adhkar" nav tab that defaults to the morning routine.
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` §5B.3 — scaffold status note (what ships, what's deferred).

### Verification
`npm run -w packages/shared test` → 74/74 (+4 adhkar tests). Typecheck + web build clean. AdhkarRoutine route chunk 8.54 KB (gz 3.07 KB); `quranCorpus` got hoisted into its own shared chunk (5.63 KB) once both QuranReader and AdhkarRoutine imported it. Total precache 214 KB.

### Not done in this pass
- Hadith-derived dua content for morning / evening / waking-up — blocked on license-audited curation.
- Bengali translation text — blocked on the same curation pass, minus the ~30% of entries that are Quran-referenced and already have Bengali via the cached `bn-muhiuddin` Quran edition (not yet wired into the adhkar reader).
- `friday-post-asr` and `post-salah` routines — deferred past v1.1a per §5B.3.
- Mobile UI — shared hook + JSON data work unchanged on Expo; the `AdhkarRoutine` React Native screen lands in Phase 4.
- Tasbih count persistence — the counter is currently ephemeral component state. Persisting to `completions[]` is a follow-up that aligns with FR-EX2.

### Still open (cumulative — updated)
- All the Session 6 items above.
- Hadith-derived adhkar curation for morning/evening/waking-up from an audited source.
- Bengali adhkar for Quran-referenced duas (free via cached corpus) + separate sourcing for hadith-derived.
- Adhkar reader per-dua persistence (daily completions, similar to reminders).
